#### About
Here I wrote a bot for discord. This is special bot for one discord server https://discord.gg/6UuPEBmxTJ
The goal of this is to manage player gathering to game: he sends messages, shows useful information, let you download maps for game.
Bot has a lot of command. To see them you need to join special server and write for bot `-join`.

#### Programming language
I wrote a bot on nodejs. So far, my project is devoid of normal style and comments, so it is useless to understand it yet.

#### Data base
I use mongodb as a database. It stores player lists, notes, and configuration. So far, I use free 220 Kb. I think that's enough for the first time.

#### Server
I bought a server on FirstByte for 55 rubles a month. Intel Xeon E5-2650, 512 MB RAM, 7 GB SSD, 7 TB traffic, Ubuntu 20.04. The cheapest server.

#### Maps
Partially implemented by the card Manager. You can display a picture and information about the map in messages. A set of maps and MapCache.ini with their information are preloaded to the server.
